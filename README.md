# Consept

A vampire the masquerade game where the player is able to set up an politic with other vampires, sects and coteries in any city in the world (or at least some of the major ones). This will be a work in concept which will feature only San Francisco as the demo. The feel of the game will be like if the player was playing ontop of a board game. For now the game will be hosted on Github Pages.

For inspiration see
- Infection Free Zone
- Cultist Simulator
- Catan Boardgame, Pandemic Boardgame

# Stage 1
Download the data of San Fransisco utilizing OpenStreetApi. This will set up the the board map. Lock the borders so that the camera does not move after a certain distance around the city (Want to not have the game load too much unnecessary stuff). 

# Stage 2
Game Mechanics to be implemented. Create a turn manager (turn manager will move forward the time aka move to the next nights) and keep track of the progression of time. It is inside of these turns that the player will be able to move and interact.
